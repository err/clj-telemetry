# clj-telemetry

A Clojure library designed to wrap [OpenTelemetry Java API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java).

## Usage

```clj
[clj-telemetry "0.2.2"]
```

1. Setup tracer

```
  (def exporter (build-exporter-jaeger "test-service-name" "localhost" "14250"))
  (def span-processor (build-simple-span-processor exporter))
  (def open-telemetry (init-open-telemetry exporter))
  (def tracer (get-tracer open-telemetry "test.tracing"))
```

2. Create span

```
(import [telemetry.tracing :as tracing])

(def span-1 (tracing/create-span tracer))

(tracing/add-event span-1 "1. first event")
(tracing/add-event span-1 "1. second event")

(tracing/end-span span-1)
```
